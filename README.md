# Chess — Training Mode (Openings + Tactics)

This build adds a **Training** panel with two modes:
- **Openings**: follow a line and get immediate feedback.
- **Tactics**: solve puzzles from FEN + UCI solution lines.

## Data loading (both supported)
1) **Repo JSON**: place files in `data/openings.json` and `data/tactics.json`.
2) **Upload JSON**: use the file pickers in the Training panel.

## Engine files required (offline)
Keep these next to `index.html`:
- stockfish-nnue-16-single.js
- stockfish-nnue-16-single.wasm

## Notes
- Elo slider uses UCI_Elo where possible and approximates low Elo via Skill Level.
- Tactics solutions use UCI moves like `e2e4`.
